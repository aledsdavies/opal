# Work Session: Project Infrastructure & Documentation Cleanup

## Context
After completing major IR architecture refactoring work (unified AST‚ÜíIR‚ÜíPlan system), the project needs infrastructure cleanup and proper documentation to reflect the current state and focus areas.

## Current Project State
‚úÖ **WORKING**: Lexer, Parser, AST‚ÜíIR transformation, Plan generation, --dry-run  
üöß **FOCUS**: Plan system and dry-run functionality  
‚ö†Ô∏è  **BROKEN**: Interpreter execution, Generated code output  
üéØ **NEXT PHASE**: Clean up infrastructure, document current state, prepare for focused execution work

## Goal
Tidy up project infrastructure and documentation to:
- Reflect current architectural state after IR refactoring
- Update documentation to match --dry-run focus
- Fix any broken pipelines/CI after major changes
- Prepare clean foundation for focused execution mode work
- Update README and docs to set proper expectations

## Plan
1. **Commit Cleanup**: Squash IR refactoring work into clean commits
2. **Documentation Updates**: Update README, ARCHITECTURE.md, etc.
3. **Pipeline Fixes**: Ensure CI/CD works with current codebase
4. **Example Updates**: Update examples to work with current plan-mode focus
5. **Nix Integration**: Fix any Nix build issues after refactoring
6. **Template Updates**: Ensure templates work with current architecture

## Current Status: Starting Infrastructure Cleanup

### Active Tasks
- [ ] Squash IR refactoring commits into clean logical commits
- [ ] Update README.md to reflect current state and focus
- [ ] Update ARCHITECTURE.md with new IR system documentation
- [ ] Fix any broken CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Update examples to showcase --dry-run functionality
- [ ] Review and update Nix builds
- [ ] Clean up template files if needed

### Files to Review/Update
- [ ] README.md - Update to reflect plan-mode focus
- [ ] docs/ARCHITECTURE.md - Document new IR system
- [ ] docs/devcmd_specification.md - Ensure spec matches implementation
- [ ] .github/workflows/ci.yml - Fix any pipeline issues
- [ ] examples/ - Update examples for current functionality
- [ ] template/ - Review template compatibility
- [ ] commands.cli - Ensure dev commands work with current state

### Key Decisions
- 2025-01-10 01:30: Focus on plan-mode and --dry-run functionality
- 2025-01-10 01:30: Document broken execution modes clearly
- 2025-01-10 01:30: Prepare clean foundation for future execution work

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Clean commit history with 2-3 logical commits for IR work
- [ ] Updated documentation accurately reflects current state
- [ ] CI/CD pipelines pass with current codebase
- [ ] Examples demonstrate working --dry-run functionality
- [ ] Clear roadmap for future execution mode work
- [ ] New contributors can understand current focus and limitations

## Timeline
- 2025-01-10 01:30: Started infrastructure cleanup phase

### Milestones
- [ ] **Commit Cleanup**: Squash IR work into clean commits
- [ ] **Documentation Pass**: Update all docs to match current state  
- [ ] **CI/CD Fix**: Ensure pipelines work
- [ ] **Examples Update**: Working examples with --dry-run
- [ ] **Project Ready**: Clean foundation for execution work

### Notes
This cleanup phase will provide a clean slate for focused development on:
1. Fixing interpreter execution mode
2. Implementing generator mode with new IR
3. Adding missing decorators and functionality
4. Performance optimizations

The goal is to have a well-documented, clean project state that clearly communicates what works, what doesn't, and what the development focus should be.
